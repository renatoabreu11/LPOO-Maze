## Maze
Without knowing, our hero finds himself lost in a labyrinth dungeon, in the company of a dragon of fixed ideas, determined to make it a
delicious meal. Somewhere in the Labyrinth, there is an exit and a sword. The exit only opens when the dragon dies. Whenever the two
are in adjacent squares the dragon attacks first, and if our hero does not own the sword, passes away. So, be careful and help our hero live to fight another day.
